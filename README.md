# rssPodcastPlayer
No podcast player had all the features I wanted, so I made my own. Allows playback and data storage for any podcast with an RSS feed.

## Features
- Pause playback on one device and pick up in the same spot on another
- Tracks what's already been played
- Light load time for use on spotty mobile networks

## Technologies used
- Vanilla JS
- Postgres
- Heroku

## Libraries
- [rss-parser](https://github.com/rbren/rss-parser)
