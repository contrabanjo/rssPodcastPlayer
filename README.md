# rssPodcastPlayer
For easy playback of podcasts using an rss feed

## Features
My main reasons for building my own rss podcast player, when several very good ones already exist, are twofold:
  1) It sounded like fun
  2) I wanted the same functionality that I get from Spotify, i.e. being able to start a podcast on one device and resume in the same spot on another device.

This app achieves that functionality with a postgres database hosted on heroku, which keeps track of my own personal metadata (current time, and whether I've already played it) for podcasts in my feed.
